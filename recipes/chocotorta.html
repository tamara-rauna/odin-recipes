        <h2>An unbelievably easy cake</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dulce de Leche or “sweet milk” from Argentina</li>
                <li>Cream Cheese</li>
                <li>Creme fraiche or sour cream (optional)</li>
                <li>Chocolinas or any brand of chocolate cookies</li>
                <li>One cup of freshly brewed coffee</li>
                <li>Valrhona dark chocolate (85%) or any quality dark chocolate for garnishing</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the cream cheese in a bowl and mix thoroughly with a hand blender. Add in the dulce de leche and continue mixing until you get a light caramel color mixture. </li>
                <li>Add sour cream or creme fraiche and mix.  Taste as you mix until you get the desired level of sweetness.</li>
                <li>Dip the chocolate cookies in freshly brewed coffee and then place them in a dessert tray.  While it’s optional,  lining the dish with parchment paper makes for less mess and easier cleanup.</li>
                <li>Be sure not to dip the chocolate cookies for too long or they will crumble. Once you have the first layer done, spread on dulce de leche mixture and evenly with a spatula</li>
                <li>Keep layering your cake until you end on the last layer of the dulce de leche mixture. </li>
                <li>For the final layer, melt a few squares of high-quality dark chocolate using the bain marie method. Once melted, spread a thin layer of the chocolate over the last dulce de leche layer.</li>
            </ol>
