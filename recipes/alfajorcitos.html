        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 3/4 cups cornstarch</li>
                <li>120 grams (about 1 cup) all-purpose flour, more as needed</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 cup (8-ounces) room-temperature unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
                <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>1 to 2 tablespoons pisco, or brandy, more as needed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup homemade or store-bought dulce de leche</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sweetened shredded dried coconut</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Place the cornstarch, flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and mix to combine.</li>
                <li>Add butter to the flour mixture, blending with your fingers until the mixture is smooth (see note in Step 4 about using stand mixer as an alternative).</li>
                <li>Add the powdered sugar, pisco, and vanilla. Combine with your hands until a smooth dough forms. Add another tablespoon or two of pisco if the dough is too crumbly to form a ball. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on low speed; this will cut the prep time down by about half. Shape the dough into a disk, wrap, and let the dough rest, refrigerated, for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350 F. Lightly flour a work surface. Roll out dough to 3/8" thickness, and cut into 2-inch circles. Combine and re-roll the scraps, continuing to cut cookies until the dough is finished.</li>
                <li>Place cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
                <li>Bake cookies one sheet at a time until the edges begin to turn golden brown, rotating the tray halfway through for 15 to 17 minutes total. Let cookies cool 5 minutes, then transfer to rack to cool completely.</li>
                <li>To fill the cookies, spread one cookie with dulce de leche.</li>
                <li>Top with a second cookie to make a sandwich. Roll the edges in the coconut, sprinkling more over the edges if the coconut doesn't adhere easily.</li>
            </ol>
